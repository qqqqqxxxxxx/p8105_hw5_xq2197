## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df =
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Letâ€™s look at this a bit.

``` r
aggregate_df =
  homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Try to iterate.

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Import the dataset.

``` r
lda_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    data = map(.x = str_c("lda_data/", path), ~read_csv(.x))
  ) %>%
  unnest(data) %>%
  mutate(
    path = substr(path, 0, 6),
    group = substr(path, 0, 3),
    sub_id = substr(path, 5, 6)) %>%
  select(path, group, sub_id, week_1:week_8) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "observation"
  ) %>%
  mutate(week = substr(week, 6, 7))
```

Create a spaghetti plot for each subject.

``` r
lda_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = path)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = group)) + 
  labs(
  title = "Longitudinal plot",
  x = "Week",
  y = "Observation",
  caption = "Data from the lda dataset"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_xq2197_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

As observed in the plot, the observation values of subjects in the
experimental group were higher than those of subjects in the control
group. Additionally, the observation values of the experimental group
continued increasing in the 8-week period, while the data of the control
group were relatively stable during the 8-week period.
